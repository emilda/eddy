# AAHYWEH
# Control file for L2 (input) to L3 (output) quality control.
#
# [Files]     - contains paths and file names
# [Soil]      - constants used in correcting Fg for storage
# [Variables] - variable names and quality control keys, only those variables
#               corrected or calculated at this level need to be specified in
#               this control file.
#               Valid quality control sections are:
#                RangeCheck   - reject data less than "Lower" or greater than "Upper"
#                DiurnalCheck - reject data outside Avg(H.h)+/-NumSd*Stdev(H.h) where
#                                Avg(H.h) is the average of all data at time H.h and
#                                Stdev(H.h) is the standard deviation of all data at time H.h
#                                 eg H.h = 8.5 is 0830
#                 NOTE: The "Lower", "Upper" and "NumSd" keywords require a value for each
#                       month of the year (12).  This can be written in shorthand as:
#                        eg "[100]*12" (same value for each month)
#                       or in longhand as:
#                        eg "[100,110,120,130,140,150,150,140,130,120,110,100]" (different each month)
#                ExcludeDates - reject data between specified dates, multiple date ranges can be
#                               specified on separate lines but the lines must be numbered
#                               sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2 etc)
#                 NOTE: The date range is specified as:
#        [[[ExcludeDates]]]
#            0 = "['2010-01-01 00:00','2010-09-16 00:00']"
#                ExcludeHours - reject data at specified times between the specified date range,
#                               multiple ranges can be specified on separate lines but the
#                               lines must be numbered sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2, etc)
#                 NOTE: The date range and hours to be rejected are specified as:
#                        eg "['2008-04-22 00:00','2008-07-26 23:30',['09:30','10:00','10:30']]"
#                Linear       - apply a linear correction to the data within a date range,
#                               multiple ranges can be specified on separate lines but the
#                               lines must be numbered sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2, etc)
#                 NOTE: The date range, slope and offset are specified as:
#                        eg "['2010-01-01 00:00','2011-01-01 00:00',1.0,0.0]"
#                Correction   - apply an offset to a wind direction measurement to correct for alignment
#                               multiple ranges can be specified on separate lines but the
#                               lines must be numbered sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2, etc)
#                 NOTE: The date range and correction are specified as follows:
#                        eg "['2009-1-1 00:00','2010-1-1 00:00',180]"
# MergeSeries
#  Used to specify the data series to be merged to form a single data series.
#  Examples of series that can be merged are soil moisture measurements at the same depth,
#  soil heat flux measurements at the same depth, air temperature and humidity series to provide
#  a single series to provide one set of data for use with the WPL correction.
